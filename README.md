Lintupongari app

A node app with react frontend build. Frontend can be found in https://github.com/SamuliVen/lintupongari .
Works with a database in MongoDB Atlas. Uses wiki API to get taxonomy data from birds saved as a sighting. 
Only works in Finnish and unfortunately doesn't work with special characters such as Ö and Ä at the moment.

The app looks best when using a regular computer screen. For the moment, there is some overlapping when using
the app with mobile devices or other small screens. There is also known issue when trying to refresh a certain page
that will redirect to unkown endpoint page.


Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3001 to view it in the browser.
